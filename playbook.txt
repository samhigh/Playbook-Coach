Core Focus Pillars:

Deep Work: I commit to two 90-minute blocks of undistracted work daily. High-quality output is a function of (Intensity of Focus) x (Time).

Physical Foundation: 30 minutes of strength training and stretching. An athlete’s mind requires an athlete's body.

Intellectual Growth: 1 hour of reading. Knowledge compounds exactly like interest in an index fund.

Investing Mantras (for Nudges):

"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient." — Warren Buffett.

"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." Apply this to your skills: weigh them by practicing daily.

Sports Mentras:

"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." (Wayne Gretzky/Michael Scott).

Focus on the process, not the scoreboard. If the process (the daily blocks) is right, the result is inevitable.
